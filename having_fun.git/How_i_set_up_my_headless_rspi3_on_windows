3 weeks ago i bought raspberry pi 3 without any additional hardware,
and without any idea of how i will make it work. 
First buy SD card / use SD card with memory greater than 8 GB and that too ultra 
for good performance.
Download OS image compatible with raspberry pi - i chose raspbian jessie, after 
downloading zip file extract iso image to your any folder 
Download Win32DiskImager and select iso file and then click write
Now image is successfully written in SD card and our raspberry pi 3 is ready booted.
But if we want to access it headlessly (without any visual) we can do so via SSH,
and setting VNCserver(VNC server is preinstalled in Raspbian Jessie).
Latest Version Raspbian Jessie has SSH diabled by default
So we can enable it by creating a file named SSH with no txt extension
(i.e. remove txt from the file name / extension) 
now we can ssh 
A) connect raspberry pi 3 to computer with ethernet cable 
B) open cmd -> ping raspberrypi.local
and you will get ip address
C) Download Putty (or any other SSH client) and enter the ip address and connect it
D) though warning may appear as technically security is being breached, but its no
issue , just Procced forward
E) enter login id as pi (raspbian default userid) and raspberry (raspbian default 
password - BE SURE TO CHANGE IT )
F)They you will be successfully logged in , now you can configure raspberry pi via
 $sudo raspi-config (MOST RECOMMENDED -> change password)
G)Now got to interfacing in rapberry pi configuration and select the VNC and 
enabled it.
H)Now Download VNC viewer (a VNCclient) on your any other device from where you will be remote 
controlling raspberry pi 3/2.
I)Now connect your raspberry pi 3 to wifi via editing /etc/network/interfaces file 
just insert this code
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
  wpa-ssid "Wifi name"
  wpa-pwd "Wifi Password"
 J) Connect your laptop/andoid phone where VNCclient/ VNC viewer is installed to same wifi
 H) ifconfig raspberry 3 to know ip address of wireless lan port to which raspi3 is
 connected to wifi
 I) now open VNC viewer and click on + and enter the ip address of rspi3
 And hence the raspberry pi 3 screen will be projected to VNC viewer and from there
 you can remotely control your device
